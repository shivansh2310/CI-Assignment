1> Computational Intelligence Experiment List
Breast cancer cell classification using K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Use the dataset of file wisc_bc_data.csv. Use the following settings to design the classifier:
Min-max feature normalization.
Out of 569 data samples use the 1 to 469 for creating training dataset. Use rest of the samples to estimate the accuracy of the classifier.
Calculate the accuracies for K = 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19

2> Breast cancer cell classification using Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Use the dataset of file wisc_bc_data.csv and following settings to design the classifier:
Min-max feature normalization.
Randomly select 100 healthy and 100 cancerous cell samples to construct the training dataset. Use rest of the samples to estimate the accuracy of the classifier.
Calculate the accuracies for K = 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19

3> (a) Write a program to generate the 100 sample point which follows the following linear equation: y=5x+3. Assume that the  x variable take the values in range [0, 10].
(b) Now add the additive white Gaussian noise N(0,1) with zero mean and unity variance to y to obtain y =y+N0,1. Now estimate the values of slope and intercept using the linear regression analysis. 
NOTE: Use the values of y  and x to estimate the value of slope and intercept.

4> Classify the mushrooms into poisonous and non-poisonous class using the Decision Tree classifier. Use the dataset named “mushrooms.csv” and use the following classifier settings to evaluate the performance of classifier:
Use 80% of the data sample to train the classifier and rest of them to evaluate the classifier performance. 
Calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, true positive rate and false positive rate.
